                <p>Hi if you haven't seen by now my name is Francisco Soltero. I am a junior at Tulane University where I am studying
                    Computer Science and Mathematics. I was born and raised in San Diego, California but my parents were originally from 
                    Puerto Rico and Argentina. I alwasy got the chance to go back to Argentina and get to see my family. All this being 
                    when I came to Tulane it was a big change but I felt I had the tools to deal with it because of how I was raised and where
                    I am from. Getting to my freshman year dorm originally thinking I was going to go into a pre med route but instead it was my 
                    sister who called me and really encouraged me to give programming and computer science a try because she knew what type of person
                    I was. I took her advice and took my first programming class and I thought at first that I was way out of place because I had 
                    never programmed prior to taking the class. I remember getting my first lab 2 weeks after learning what python was and it was to complete
                    a partially completed wordle in python. The project took me a whole week because I was stuck on getting the keys to change color 
                    based on the correctness of the letters. But I remember the feeling of when I finally cracked the lab and from that day forward I couldn't 
                    imagine myself doing anything else. I then built my own text based adventure game with help from my professor, but then I turned it into
                    its own application where using the JFrame library in java. After that I also built a MIPS dissasembler in java that can translate
                    binary code into readable mips code.
